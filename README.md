# Multiprocessing Performance Analysis

This repository contains two programs that utilize multiprocessing: one implementing the Monte Carlo method and the other utilizing Random Forest. Each program allows for adjusting the number of processing cores used (from 1 to 4) and outputs the execution time for each configuration. This setup allows for investigating the behavior and performance impact of multiprocessing.

## Programs

1. **Monte Carlo Method**
2. **Random Forest**

## Usage
Simply execute the programs.
